Description: Password strength checking for Kerberos KDCs
 krb5-strength provides a password quality plugin for the MIT Kerberos KDC
 (specifically the kadmind server) and an external password quality
 program for use with the Heimdal kpasswdd server.  Passwords can be
 tested with CrackLib, checked against a CDB database of known weak
 passwords, checked for length, checked for non-printable or non-ASCII
 characters that may be difficult to enter reproducibly, required to
 contain a non-alphabetic character, or any combination of these tests.
 .
 No dictionary is shipped with this package.  A CrackLib dictionary can be
 created with the tools in cracklib-runtime, a CDB database can be created
 from a password list (obtained separately) using the tools included in
 this package, or both.
