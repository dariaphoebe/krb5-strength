krb5-strength (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - SQLite password dictionaries are now supported and can be used to
      reject passwords within edit distance one of any dictionary word.
    - cdbmake-wordlist has been renamed to krb5-strength-wordlist and can
      also generate SQLite databases compatible with this plugin and
      Heimdal quality check program.
    - heimdal-history, a password history implementation for Heimdal, has
      been added and can be stacked with heimdal-strength to check both
      history and password strength.
    - New configuration option, minimum_different, which sets the minimum
      number of different characters required in a password.
  * Add the upstream signing key to debian/upstream/signing-key.asc and
    configure uscan to do signature validation.  Configure uscan to
    download the xz tarball instead of the gz tarball.
  * Create a _history user and group and a /var/lib/heimdal-history
    directory on package installation for the use of heimdal-history,
    remove the user and the standard database on purge, and remove the
    directory if empty on package purge or removal.

    - Support for more complex length-sensitive character class
      restrictions using the new require_classes configuration setting.
    - cdbmake-wordlist now supports filtering out words based on maximum
      length and user-supplied regular expressions, and supports running
      in filter mode to generate a new word list.
  * Update to standards version 3.9.5 (no changes required).

krb5-strength (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian.  (Closes: #725753)
  * New upstream release.
    - Add native support for the MIT Kerberos password quality plugin
      interface included in MIT Kerberos 1.9 and later.
    - Stop building the Heimdal plugin.  Heimdal prefers using an external
      check program anyway.
    - Add support for TinyCDB dictionaries with a simpler dictionary
      lookup algorithm.  This allows use of this package to check
      passwords against a large, fast dictionary with a minimum of
      permutations as an alternative or supplement to the extensive
      permutations tested by CrackLib.
    - Minimum password length can now be enforced directly through
      configuration of this module without relying on CrackLib.
    - New boolean settings require_ascii_printable and require_non_letter
      to reject passwords with non-ASCII or non-printable characters and
      to require passwords contain at least one non-letter (and
      non-space).
    - The plugin and external checking program will now run without a
      dictionary configured so that they can be used only to check length
      and the lighter character restrictions if so desired.
    - When checking for passwords based on the principal, also check each
      component of the principal to find passwords based on the realm.
  * Eliminate the heimdal-strength package.  krb5-strength now builds a
    single binary package of the same name including the MIT plugin and
    the Heimdal external password quality program.  The Heimdal plugin is
    not built by the Debian packaging because Heimdal prefers external
    programs.  The plugin can be added later as a separate package if
    there is demand.
  * Revise the package long description for the merger of krb5-strength
    and heimdal-strength and the new capabilities in 2.0.
  * Recommend cracklib-runtime and tinycdb since they are required to
    build dictionaries.  Downgrade krb5-admin-server to Enhances and add
    heimdal-kdc.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V9.
    - Enable hardening flags, including bindnow and PIE.
    - Enable parallel builds.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to rebuild the build system during package builds.
  * Use xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs.
  * Add branch information to the Vcs-Git metadata.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4 (no changes required).
  * Rewrite debian/copyright in copyright-format 1.0.
  * Remove README.Debian.  All of that information is now available in the
    installed upstream README file.
  * Remove Bugs header now that this package is in Debian proper.
