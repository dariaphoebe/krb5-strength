                    User-Visible krb5-strength Changes

krb5-strength 1.0 (2010-02-16)

    Add heimdal-strength, a program that checks password strength using
    the protocol for a Heimdal external check program.

    The shared module now also exports the interface expected by Heimdal's
    dynamically loaded password strength checking API and can be used as a
    Heimdal kadmin plugin.

    Add a new plugin API for MIT Kerberos modelled after the plugin API
    used for other MIT Kerberos plugins.  Thanks to Marcus Watts for
    substantial research and contributions to the interface design.  This
    work is incomplete in this release, missing the corresponding patch to
    MIT Kerberos.

    Fixed the data format written by the included packer program to add
    enough nul bytes at the end of the data.  Previously, there was not
    enough trailing nul bytes for the expected input format, leading to
    uninitialized memory reads in the password lookup.

    Add a test suite using the driver and library from C TAP Harness 1.1.

    Add portability code for platforms without a working snprintf or other
    deficiencies and updated the code to take advantage of those
    guarantees.

krb5-strength 0.5 (2007-07-18)

    The check of the password against the principal checked against the
    fully-qualified principal, which is not the usual problem.
    Additionally check that the password doesn't match the principal with
    the realm removed or the reverse of that (case-insensitive).

krb5-strength 0.4 (2007-03-28)

    The patches directory was omitted from the distribution.  Really
    include it.

krb5-strength 0.3 (2007-03-23)

    Initial public release.  Includes a patch for MIT Kerberos, a slightly
    modified version of CrackLib, and glue wrapped around CrackLib to make
    a loadable module.
