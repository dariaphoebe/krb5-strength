 * Offer the option of building with a system CrackLib library instead of
   the embedded one.  This should come with better documentation of the
   modifications made to the embedded CrackLib and what problems one may
   encounter using an unmodified version.

 * The kadmind patch needs to abort kadmind startup if the plugin could
   not be loaded, or at least needs to reject every password.
