 * Update to CrackLib 2, which is currently shipped in Debian.  This
   requires testing to confirm that the on-disk data format is still the
   same.

 * Feed back modifications to CrackLib 2 to allow a program to use a
   custom set of rules, which would allow us to stop embedding our own
   copy of CrackLib customized to add additional rules.

 * The kadmind patch needs to abort kadmind startup if the plugin could
   not be loaded, or at least needs to reject every password.
