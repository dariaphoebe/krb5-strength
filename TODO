                         krb5-strength To-Do List

 * Update to CrackLib 2.9, which is currently shipped in Debian.  This
   requires testing to confirm that the on-disk data format is still the
   same.

 * Feed back modifications to CrackLib to allow a program to use a custom
   set of rules, which would allow us to stop embedding our own copy of
   CrackLib customized to add additional rules.

 * Do something useful with errors when parsing numeric arguments from
   krb5.conf configuration.
