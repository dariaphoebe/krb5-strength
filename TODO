 * Offer the option of building with a system CrackLib library instead of
   the embedded one.  This should come with better documentation of the
   modifications made to the embedded CrackLib and what problems one may
   encounter using an unmodified version.

 * Update to CrackLib 2, which is currently shipped in Debian.  This
   requires testing to confirm that the on-disk data format is still the
   same.

 * Feed back modifications to CrackLib 2 to allow a program to use a
   custom set of rules, which would allow us to stop embedding our own
   copy of CrackLib customized to add additional rules.

 * The kadmind patch needs to abort kadmind startup if the plugin could
   not be loaded, or at least needs to reject every password.
