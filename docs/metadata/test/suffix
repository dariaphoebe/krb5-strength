To run the test suite, you will need Perl 5.010 or later and the
dependencies of the `heimdal-history` program.  The following additional
Perl modules will also be used by the test suite if present:

* Perl6::Slurp
* Test::MinimumVersion
* Test::Perl::Critic
* Test::Pod
* Test::Spelling
* Test::Strict

All are available on CPAN.  Some tests will be skipped if the modules
are not available.
