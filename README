BLURB

  krb5-strength provides a password quality plugin for the MIT Kerberos
  KDC (specifically the kadmind server), an external password quality
  program for use with Heimdal, and a per-principal password history
  implementation for Heimdal.  Passwords can be tested with CrackLib,
  checked against a CDB or SQLite database of known weak passwords with
  some transformations, checked for length, checked for non-printable or
  non-ASCII characters that may be difficult to enter reproducibly,
  required to contain particular character classes, or any combination of
  these tests.  It supports both Heimdal and MIT Kerberos (1.9 or later).

DESCRIPTION

  Heimdal includes a capability to plug in external password quality
  checks and comes with an example that checks passwords against CrackLib.
  However, in testing at Stanford, we found that CrackLib with its default
  transform rules does not catch passwords that can be guessed using the
  same dictionary with other tools, such as Jack the Ripper.  We then
  discovered other issues with CrackLib with longer passwords, such as
  some bad assumptions about how certain measures of complexity will
  scale, and wanted to impose other limitations that it didn't support.

  This plugin provides the ability to check password quality against the
  standard version of CrackLib, or against a modified version of CrackLib
  that only passes passwords that resist attacks from both Crack and Jack
  the Ripper using the same rule sets.  It also supports doing simpler
  dictionary checks against a CDB database, which is fast with very large
  dictionaries, or a SQLite database, which can reject all passwords
  within edit distance one of a dictionary word.  It can also impose other
  programmatic checks on passwords such as character class requirements.

  For Heimdal, it includes both a program usable as an external password
  quality check and a plugin that implements the dynamic module API.  For
  MIT Kerberos (1.9 or later), it includes a plugin for the password
  quality (pwqual) plugin API.

  krb5-strength can be built with either the system CrackLib or with the
  modified version of CrackLib included in this package.  Note, however,
  that if you're building against the system CrackLib, Heimdal includes in
  the distribution a strength-checking plugin and an external password
  check program that use the system CrackLib.  With Heimdal, it would
  probably be easier to use that plugin or program than build this package
  unless you want the modified CrackLib.

  For information about the changes to the CrackLib included in this
  toolkit, see cracklib/HISTORY.  The primary changes are tighter rules,
  which are more aggressive at finding dictionary words with characters
  appended and prepended, which tighten the requirements for password
  entropy, and which add stricter rules for longer passwords.  They are
  also minor changes to fix portability issues and remove some code that
  doesn't make sense in the kadmind context.

  Ideally, the changes to CrackLib should be added to the standard
  CrackLib distribution by adding an additional interface to configure its
  behavior, at which point this package can likely wither away in favor of
  much simpler plugins that link to the standard CrackLib library.

  krb5-strength also includes a password history implementation for
  Heimdal.  This is separate from the password strength implementation but
  can be stacked with it so that both strength and history checks are
  performed.  This history implementation is available only via the
  Heimdal external password quality interface.  MIT Kerberos includes its
  own password history implementation.

REQUIREMENTS

  For Heimdal, you may use either the external password quality check
  tool, installed as heimdal-strength, or the plugin as you choose.  It
  has been tested with Heimdal 1.2.1 and later, but has not recently been
  tested with versions prior to 1.5.

  For MIT Kerberos, version 1.9 or higher is required for the password
  quality plugin interface.  MIT Kerberos does not support an external
  password quality check tool directly, so you will need to install the
  plugin.

  You can optionally build against the system CrackLib library.  Any
  version should be supported, but note that some versions, particularly
  older versions close to the original code, do things like printing
  diagnostics to stderr, calling exit, and otherwise not being
  well-behaved for use inside plugins or libraries.  If using a system
  CrackLib library, use version 2.8.22 or later to avoid these problems.

  You can also optionally build against the TinyCDB library, which
  provides support for simpler and faster password checking against a CDB
  dictionary file, and the SQLite library (a version new enough to support
  the sqlite3_open_v2 API; 3.7 should be more than sufficient), which
  provides support for checking whether passwords are within edit distance
  one of a dictionary word.

  For this module to be effective for either Heimdal or MIT Kerberos, you
  will also need to construct a dictionary.  The mkdict and packer
  utilities to build a CrackLib dictionary from a word list are included
  in this toolkit but not installed by default.  You can run them out of
  the cracklib directory after building.  You can also use the utilities
  that come with the stock CrackLib package (often already packaged in a
  Linux distribution); the database format is compatible.

  For building a CDB or SQLite dictionary, use the provided
  krb5-strength-wordlist program.  For CDB dictionries, the cdb utility
  must be on your PATH.  For SQLite, the DBI and DBD::SQLite Perl modules
  are required.  krb5-strength-wordlist requires Perl 5.006 or later.

  For a word list to use as source for the dictionary, you can use
  /usr/share/dict/words if it's available on your system, but it would be
  better to find a more comprehensive word list.  Since word lists are
  bulky, often covered by murky copyrights, and easily locatable on the
  Internet with a modicum of searching, none are included in this toolkit.

  The password history program, heimdal-history, requires Perl 5.010 or
  later plus the following CPAN modules:

      DB_File::Lock
      Crypt::PBKDF2
      Getopt::Long::Descriptive
      IPC::Run
      JSON
      Readonly

  and their dependencies.

  To run the test suite, you will need Perl 5.010 or later and the
  dependencies of the heimdal-history program.  The following additional
  Perl modules will also be used by the test suite if present:

      Perl6::Slurp
      Test::MinimumVersion
      Test::Perl::Critic
      Test::Pod
      Test::Spelling
      Test::Strict

  All are available on CPAN.  Some tests will be skipped if the modules
  are not available.

  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.

  To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or If you change the Automake files
  and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or
  later.  For bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4
  files it includes and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you
  will need Autoconf 2.64 or later.  You will also need Perl 5.010 or
  later and the DBI, DBD::SQLite, JSON, Perl6::Slurp, and Readonly modules
  (from CPAN) to bootstrap the test suite data from a Git checkout.

COMPILING AND INSTALLING

  You can build and install the plugin with the standard commands:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  Pass --enable-silent-rules to configure for a quieter build (similar to
  the Linux kernel).  Use make warnings instead of make to build with full
  GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

  The last step will probably have to be done as root.  By default, the
  plugin is installed as /usr/local/lib/krb5/plugins/pwqual/strength.so
  and the Heimdal external password check function is installed as
  /usr/local/bin/heimdal-strength.  You can change these paths with the
  --prefix, --libdir, and --bindir options to configure.

  To build with the system version of CrackLib, pass --with-cracklib to
  configure.  You can optionally add a directory, giving the root
  directory where CrackLib was installed, or separately set the include
  and library path with --with-cracklib-include and --with-cracklib-lib.

  krb5-strength will automatically build with TinyCDB if it is found.  To
  specify the installation path of TinyCDB, use --with-tinycdb.  You can
  also separately set the include and library path with
  --with-tinycdb-include and --with-tinycdb-lib.

  Similarly, krb5-strength will automatically build with SQLite if it is
  found.  To specify the installation path of SQLite, use --with-sqlite.
  You can also separately set the include and library path with
  --with-sqlite-include and --with-sqlite-lib.

  Normally, configure will use krb5-config to determine the flags to use
  to compile with your Kerberos libraries.  If krb5-config isn't found, it
  will look for the standard Kerberos libraries in locations already
  searched by your compiler.  If the the krb5-config script first in your
  path is not the one corresponding to the Kerberos libraries you want to
  use or if your Kerberos libraries and includes aren't in a location
  searched by default by your compiler, you need to specify a different
  Kerberos installation root via --with-krb5=PATH.  For example:

      ./configure --with-krb5=/usr/pubsw

  You can also individually set the paths to the include directory and the
  library directory with --with-krb5-include and --with-krb5-lib.  You may
  need to do this if Autoconf can't figure out whether to use lib, lib32,
  or lib64 on your platform.

  To specify a particular krb5-config script to use, either set the
  PATH_KRB5_CONFIG environment variable or pass it to configure like:

      ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config

  To not use krb5-config and force library probing even if there is a
  krb5-config script on your path, set PATH_KRB5_CONFIG to a nonexistent
  path:

      ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent

  krb5-config is not used and library probing is always done if either
  --with-krb5-include or --with-krb5-lib are given.

  You can pass the --enable-reduced-depends flag to configure to try to
  minimize the shared library dependencies encoded in the binaries.  This
  omits from the link line all the libraries included solely because the
  Kerberos libraries depend on them and instead links the programs only
  against libraries whose APIs are called directly.  This will only work
  with shared Kerberos libraries and will only work on platforms where
  shared libraries properly encode their own dependencies (such as Linux).
  It is intended primarily for building packages for Linux distributions
  to avoid encoding unnecessary shared library dependencies that make
  shared library migrations more difficult.  If none of the above made any
  sense to you, don't bother with this flag.

  After installing this software, see the man pages for krb5-strength,
  heimdal-strength, and heimdal-history for configuration information.
